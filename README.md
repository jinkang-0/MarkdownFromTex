## Markdown From Tex

A short Python script I wrote to convert the .tex homework files in CS 70 into workable markdown files (primarily for Obsidian view).

Not perfect, but gets the job done.
May be updated to make it compatible with other tex commands when they show up on the homework in the future.

Requirements:
- Have Python installed (tested in python3, version compatibility unsure)

Instructions for use:
1. Download the source code and put it in its own folder
2. Put the .tex file in the same folder as the scripts
3. Rename the .tex file to "input.tex"
4. In the terminal, run `python script.py`
5. Enjoy the outputted .md file

Note: Feel free to edit how the files are parsed and formatted in `script.py`
